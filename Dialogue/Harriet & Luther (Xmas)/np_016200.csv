text01002#0,"""By the by, I'd appreciate it if you listened to what my sister here has to say. She's found these decorations rather entrancing."""
11_voice_NPC_5620_104#0,"""そうそう、まずは<br>隣にいる妹の話を聞いてやって欲しい。<br>周囲の装飾に随分と心奪われていてね。"""
text02001#0,"""I was just studying those plants that we gathered for Harriet's gifts. It seemed a reasonable way to pass the time."""
text02002#0,"""They're rather different from the plants that I know, both ecologically and in terms of Mana composition. Quite fascinating, I must say."""
11_voice_NPC_5620_101#0,"""僕が知る植物とは生態も<br>マナの構成も大きく異なっている。<br>興味深いものばかりだ。"""
text02003#0,"""Harriet seems to have a knack for identifying useful materials in this world. No doubt she will ask you for help again."""
text03001#0,"""Ever since we came here, Harriet has seemed a lot more relaxed."""
11_voice_NPC_5620_100#0,"""ここに来てから、ハリエットが<br>のびのびと楽しんでいるようだ。"""
text03002#0,"""My sister is dreadfully serious by nature, so it might not be a bad thing if she is taking the chance to spread her wings."""
text04001#0,"""Two people from another world suddenly appear, clad in Santa's guise, to spend Christmas here.<br>Does this situation not intrigue you?"""
text04002#0,"""Truly, human wishes always have such unexpected results."""
11_voice_NPC_5620_101#1,"""まったく、人の願いというものは<br>いつも予想外の結果を<br>見せてくれる。"""
text04003#0,"""One could say that figures like Santa are born from people's wishes. Perhaps we... No, let's not go there."""
text05001#0,"""Really, I had no idea Harriet still believed in fairy stories, let alone one I read to her so long ago."""
11_voice_NPC_5620_101#2,"""まさかハリエットが<br>大昔に読み聞かせたおとぎ話を<br>信じていたとは、驚いたよ。"""
text05002#0,"""Supposedly, beings like us disappear when our wishes are fulfilled...<br>Though it seems there is something of a grace period."""
text05003#0,"""Harriet still wishes to enjoy Christmas. Seeing her thus, I too will indulge."""
11_voice_NPC_5620_100#1,"""ハリエットは、まだまだ<br>クリスマスを楽しみたいようだ。<br>であれば、僕もそれに倣おう。"""
text05004#0,"""By the way, I believe my sister has been preparing dinner for you. I do hope you'll appreciate it."""
