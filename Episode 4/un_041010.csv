un_041010_0020#0,"""Coming to visit me means that you've stabalized a bit, right?"""
un_041010_0030#0,"""I thought it would be troublesome if I bothered you so soon after waking, and you were probably busy anyway. So I waited here, so that I wouldn't get in your way."""
un_041010_0040#0,"""How long has it been since the last time we had a proper chat?"""
un_041010_0050#0,"""I heard you were doing okay while you were sleeping, so it's not like I was worried or anything. But I definitely feel more at ease now that we've talked."""
un_041010_0060#0,"""I know you're thinking it's not a big deal, but it was quite a long time for everyone who wasn't sleeping."""
un_041010_0070#0,"""1. You've become more mature"""
un_041010_0080#0,"""2. You've become more beautiful"""
un_041010_0090#0,"""Y-You think so? Well, I mean- if time goes by, even I'll mature, you know?"""

un_041010_0110#0,"""You know senior, trying to embarrass me by saying something weird is a waste of time."""
un_041010_0120#0,"""I've gotten used to being teased, I won't be put off balance just by that..."""
un_041010_0130#0,"""Senior, you're close! Too close!"""
un_041010_0140#0,"""Jeez, you always act so suddenly! If you do too many strange things, I'm going to tell Matoi!"""
un_041010_0150#0,"""Haha, when we have these exchanges, it feels like you've truly come back."""
un_041010_0160#0,"""I know I'm late doing it, but... Welcome back, senior. I've been waiting."""
