st_044070_0010#0,"""Alright, we're here."""
st_044070_0020#0,"""Wow! So pretty! This place is huge!<br>To build something like this under Las Vegas...<br>What kind of organizational capacity does Earth Guide even have...?"""
st_044070_0030#0,"""After entering a casino in Las Vegas,<br>we went further underground via elevator and<br>changed elevators twice again before reaching our destination..."""
st_044070_0040#0,"""It seems like they've taken extreme caution to<br>prevent any specific pin-points from being made."""
st_044070_0050#0,"""Well, it's just in case. Although, I'm not sure how much it'd even help in this world, with the widespread Ether infrastructure."""
st_044070_0060#0,"""Haha, things are getting quite lively around here, aren't they?"""
st_044070_0070#0,"""That's what I told you before. And even so, you still insisted I bring them here. Isn't that right, prince?"""
st_044070_0080#0,"""I don't mind, I prefer things to be lively."""
st_044070_0090#0,"""<%me>, Hitsugi. It's an honor to meet you both."""
st_044070_0100#0,"""My name is Ardem Sacred. Although, there are those who tease me and call me 'Prince'. But please, call me by my name."""
st_044070_0110#0,"""Prince...? Then, wait, you're...!"""
st_044070_0120#0,"""Correct. To put it plainly, I am currently the leader of Earth Guide. I'm looking forward to working with you."""
st_044070_0130#0,"""Ah, uhm, same here. Thank you."""
st_044070_0140#0,"""<%me>. I've heard many rumors about you. I'm honored to finally meet you in person."""
st_044070_0150#0,"""I'm sorry for having to invite you to a place like this."""
st_044070_0160#0,"""1. Many rumors?"""
st_044070_0170#0,"""2. Don't worry about it."""
st_044070_0180#0,"""You didn't hear about it from Enga? For some time now, Earth Guide and ARKS have been communicating in secret."""
st_044070_0190#0,"""I've been told many things about you, <%me>. Powerful, righteous... and with a kind heart."""
st_044070_0200#0,"""Haha, I see. The rumors of you being kind are true."""
st_044070_0210#0,"""All the stories I've heard about you were full of compliments and praise. It seems you mostly just nod and smile, dealing with whatever comes your way."""
st_044070_0220#0,"""And when I think to myself that you all came from an alternate dimension... As an Earthling, this meeting has me deep in thought."""
st_044070_0230#0,"""Oh, right... PSO2 isn't a game, but a window to an alternate dimension... So, <%me> is technically a space alien."""
st_044070_0240#0,"""Or rather, someone from another world? A person from an alternate dimension? What am I supposed to label them? Ugh, I guess it's not important..."""
st_044070_0250#0,"""I guess because of all the commotion and talking we did, I never really gave it much thought, but... This is actually a pretty big deal, huh?"""
st_044070_0260#0,"""It's probably enough to spin the heads of scientists studying the Earth and it's life."""
st_044070_0270#0,"""Now, I have gathered you all here for a reason. Please let me explain the current situation on Earth."""
st_044070_0280#0,"""The increase of Mother Cluster actively has been noticed by ARKS as well."""
st_044070_0290#0,"""On Earth's side, the attacks on Earth Guide has increased. Most branches and members have suffered losses... To be honest, our situation is kind of grim."""
st_044070_0300#0,"""Previously, we had a lot of situations where we would just have a staredown, but now it seems they've stopped caring. They're agressively trying to destroy us."""
st_044070_0310#0,"""Maybe they were waiting until they were ready, or they needed to rush into it all of the sudden... There's no way of knowing, but it's a pretty bad situation either way."""
st_044070_0320#0,"""Tell me, please, what is Mother Cluster's motive? What do they plan to do after they destroy Earth Guide?"""
st_044070_0330#0,"""After the destruction of Earth Guide, they'd be able to completely conquer the Earth. We're the last bastion of hope."""
st_044070_0340#0,"""In some ways, their control of the Ether infrastructure has really helped them with that goal."""
st_044070_0345#0,"""Although, it doesn't explain why they're using PSO2 to try and infiltrate the Oracle fleet."""
st_044070_0350#0,"""1. Are they planning to take over our world too?"""
st_044070_0360#0,"""2. Is there something in our world they need?"""
st_044070_0370#0,"""Perhaps... Clearly, there must be something in the ARKS universe that they need."""
st_044070_0380#0,"""So, Ms. stupid younger sister, former member of Mother Cluster, what do you think?"""
st_044070_0390#0,"""Stop talking to me like that! But, hm... what are mother's intentions...?"""
st_044070_0400#0,"""It's been quite a while since I joined Mother Cluster... I was told I was invited because 'I had experience'."""
st_044070_0410#0,"""'Experience' like refers to your ability to enter PSO2. That's an Ether ability, so it seems like they're gathering those with an aptitude for it."""
st_044070_0420#0,"""They're likely trying to find people with high potential. Learning the different abilites of Ether would be like master the technology. If you understand how it works and devote yourself, you should get more powerful."""
st_044070_0430#0,"""Wait, so it's something that can be mastered through hard work and practice? Like making a weapon out of Ether?"""
st_044070_0434#0,"""To put it simply, the more your aptitude with Ether rises, the more you can do with it."""
st_044070_0438#0,"""Furthermore, even regular people without an aptitude for Ether, through PSO2, can remotely control an avatar created in Oracle to enjoy the game."""
st_044070_0440#0,"""However, PSO2 is an application created by Mother to infiltrate Oracle undetected."""
st_044070_0444#0,"""Hence, whenever an ordinary person plays PSO2 as a normal game, Mother is still gaining intelligence on ARKS."""
st_044070_0448#0,"""The other role of the PSO2 application is to scout out people with high Ether aptitude."""
st_044070_0450#0,"""To make it easier to understand... If we use levels to show aptitude, someone who has a level 1 aptitude can dive into PSO2."""
st_044070_0454#0,"""Diving into PSO2 is when you merge with the avatar you created in PSO2 and allows one to move as you would your own body."""
st_044070_0458#0,"""These level 1 aptitude users are discovered by Mother and chosen to be part of Mother Cluster."""
st_044070_0460#0,"""Once their aptitude rises, and becomes level 2, it becomes possible to dive without an avatar. You can cross over with your own body."""
st_044070_0465#0,"""In addition, the embodiment of Ether into a weapon becomes possible."""
st_044070_0470#0,"""So, according to this explanation, both Enga and Ms. Hitsugi have already reached level 2."""
st_044070_0480#0,"""Those who have reached that point become the core of Mother Cluster and strengthen their influence over the world."""
st_044070_0490#0,"""Making use of Mother Cluster, they become successful in this society. For example, Hagito and Bethor."""
st_044070_0500#0,"""Among the core members of Mother Cluster, the seven with exceptional abilities are known as apostles and are treated as Mother's closest aides."""
st_044070_0510#0,"""使徒に選ばれたことで受ける社会的な恩恵も<br>また、莫大なものでしょうね。"""
st_044070_0520#0,"""……なるほど。あたしやコオリも<br>レベル１のエーテル適性があったから<br>マザー・クラスタに誘われたんだね。"""
st_044070_0530#0,"""素養を持つ人物を囲い込み<br>そのうちの一部でもレベル２へと至れば<br>十分と、考えたのでしょう。"""
st_044070_0540#0,"""……それにしても、アースガイドは<br>よくそんなのに気付けたね。"""
st_044070_0550#0,"""僕達も、それなりに社会に<br>影響力を持ち合わせていますので。"""
st_044070_0560#0,"""そーだぜ、何やったかはしらねーけど<br>こいつなんか、爵位持ちだぞ、爵位。<br>サー・アーデムだぜ？\u3000意味不明だろ。"""
st_044070_0570#0,"""それに、もともと具現武装能力に近いものを<br>マザー・クラスタが生まれる以前より<br>行使していましたので。"""
st_044070_0580#0,"""具現武装能力に近いもの？"""
st_044070_0590#0,"""一般大衆的には『魔法』と呼ばれています。<br>古より現在まで、連綿と受け継がれながら<br>秘匿され続けている、超常的な現象の総称です。"""
st_044070_0600#0,"""転移なんかもやろうと思えば出来るぜ。<br>陣を張ったり符を用意したりと<br>めちゃくちゃ下準備が必要だけどな。"""
st_044070_0610#0,"""元々、アースガイドはマザー・クラスタの<br>対抗組織ではありませんでした。"""
st_044070_0620#0,"""はるかな昔より、世界で起こる<br>不可思議な事件や事象の解決を目的として<br>能力者が集った組織、それがアースガイドです。"""
st_044070_0630#0,"""エクソシストとか、魔術師ってヤツだな。<br>日本でなら陰陽師とか呼ばれるたぐいのアレ。<br>ああいうのの集まった集団さ。"""
st_044070_0640#0,"""天使や悪魔、鬼とか妖怪とか……とにかく普段は<br>目にも見えない異形の存在に、人知れずこっそり<br>対応するのが、アースガイドの役目だった。"""
st_044070_0650#0,"""本来、そういった非現実的といわれる現象は<br>頻発するものではありません。<br>アースガイドで十分管理しきれる範囲でした。"""
st_044070_0660#0,"""しかし、１２年前から状況は変わります。"""
st_044070_0670#0,"""１２年前って……「エーテル」が発見されて<br>「エスカ」が普及して……<br>マザー・クラスタが、生まれた年？"""
st_044070_0680#0,"""はい。その年を境に世界各地で<br>非現実的な現象が頻発するようになり<br>また、能力に目覚める人も増えていきました。"""
st_044070_0690#0,"""……オレもその一人、ってわけだ。"""
st_044070_0700#0,"""ヒツギさんやエンガのように能力に目覚めた方は<br>己の意志でエーテルを操り<br>イメージを具現化します。"""
st_044070_0710#0,"""しかし、能力に目覚めていなくとも<br>人々の恐怖心などの大衆的なイメージが集い<br>その集大成として、エーテルは形を為してしまう。"""
st_044070_0720#0,"""つまり、あたしたちの具現武装は<br>一人一人の想像力の塊で、幻創種は<br>みんなの恐怖のイメージの塊ってこと？"""
st_044070_0730#0,"""はい、その認識で間違いありません。"""
st_044070_0740#0,"""そして今、マザー・クラスタは恐怖の化身である<br>幻創種を操り、僕達にその牙を向けている。"""
st_044070_0750#0,"""……おそらくは、地球を征服するために。"""
st_044070_0760#0,"""……僕達は、太古より人ならざるものから<br>人々を守ってきました。今回も、同じです。"""
st_044070_0770#0,"""ただ、マザー・クラスタの力は尋常ではなく<br>僕達の力だけでは……おそらく……"""
st_044070_0780#0,"""だから、<%me>さん。<br>どうかお願いです。貴方の力を……<br>アークスの力を貸していただけないでしょうか。"""
st_044070_0790#0,"""かの、マザーを打倒し<br>地球をあるべき状態に戻すために……"""
st_044070_0800#0,"""な、何！\u3000地震！？"""
st_044070_0810#0,"""違う……これは、爆発だ！"""
st_044070_0820#0,"""エーテルの過剰反応を感知。<br>地上に閉鎖領域を展開しました。"""
st_044070_0830#0,"""……ずいぶん早いご到着だな。<br>アーデム、どうする？"""
st_044070_0840#0,"""アースガイドの意志を<br>示す時が来たんだよ。"""
st_044070_0850#0,"""アースガイドは、アークスと共に<br>マザーへと反抗する。<br>ここがその起点となる場所だ。"""
st_044070_0860#0,"""……真っ向迎え撃つ、ってわけだな。<br>まったく、オレたち働き者だぜ、なあ？"""
