st_048150_0030#0,"""I... don't understand."""
st_048150_0040#0,"""Why... do you resist creation? What awaits ahead is... only destruction. You humans should know this."""
st_048150_0050#0,"""It's not that we're refusing it. I'm saying that, even if we don't rely on you, people can walk with their own two feet."""
st_048150_0060#0,"""Hey, God... We humans aren't perfect like you, and we make mistakes. I'm sure it's irritating to watch."""
st_048150_0070#0,"""But still... We've made it this far. We make mistake, after mistake, after mistake... and yet we keep moving towards the future."""
st_048150_0080#0,"""So... Keep watching over us, God. See the future we make for ourselves. Our future..."""
st_048150_0090#0,"""To surpass even God... to create a future... Fu, haha... Hahahaha... You've certainly earned this future."""
st_048150_0100#0,"""However... God is immortal. If people desire it, I will be embodied once more."""

st_048150_0170#0,"""But you know, Earth won't be destroyed that easily. It's true that we may be foolish, but we still have things to do."""
st_048150_0180#0,"""For now, just leave it all to us. We'll make it all work, somehow."""
st_048150_0190#0,"""The remains of the Ether I left behind will reform into God, and come again."""

st_048150_0203#0,"""No, that won't be all. Taking in the tens of thousands of years of my despair, it will likely embody itself into something much stronger, much darker."""
