# PSO2 SEA Archive
Welcome to the PSO2 SEA Archive Repository.

This repository contains the extracted text files from the (now offline) South East Asia version of PSO2.

### But I thought the PSO2 SEA translation was bad?
It was! However, it only gets really bad after Dark Falz Elder appears. The current theory is that SEGA of America did the translation up until that point and planned to use it for PSO2NA/EU. However, something happened, and the game never came to NA/EU. The work they had done was then sent over to Asiasoft to help kickstart their "English" server. Once they ran out of high-quality SEGA of America translations, however, that is when they began to translate it themselves. (And when the quality tanked and it became really bad).

### Why do I see JP lines in these text files?
Apparently, the SEA data files saved the original Japanese translation inside of them, along with the English translation. The purpose is not clearly defined, although we can assume it was to make translation/checking easier. Or perhaps they intended to make the game available in English and Japanese in NA/EU? We'll likely never know, sadly.

### Please note that this is an ARCHIVE. You cannot edit files in here and any PRs proposed to this branch will be closed.
