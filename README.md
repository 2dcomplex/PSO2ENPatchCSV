# PSO2 Russian Patch 
Welcome to the PSO2 Russian Patch CSV Repository.

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Arks-Layer/PSO2ENPatchCSV/tree/RU.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Arks-Layer/PSO2ENPatchCSV/tree/RU)

This repository is dedicated to translating PSO2 game texts from Japanese/English to Russian.

We hope our disclosing of game texts and opening this repository will pave a quicker way for non-Japanese speaking ARKS to enjoy the game in their native language.
## Contributions
### To-Do
Any CSV files located in [Files] are still to be translated, while the CSV files in other folders are at least partly translated.

### Don't know Japanese but still want to contribute?
If you don't understand Japanese, but still want to help out, you can look over the translated lines and make sure all grammar and spelling is correct.

### Notice
* If you want to translate a file that's in the "/Files/" directory then you **MUST** [move the file into another directory](https://github.com/blog/1436-moving-and-renaming-files-on-github) before you translate it. The /Files/ directory **MUST** only contain untranslated files.
* You can find stuff to translate by using the GLaDOS bot in the #translations-public room on the **[PSO2 Discord Server]**. Usage will be in the pinned messages.
* Maintain the triple quotes and only edit the text inside the quotes.
* Be sure to take a look at the **[Wiki]** page for guides and reminders before sending us your translations.
* You may create new issues to discuss the translations with other translators. Please note that issues not related to translation may be deleted without notice.

### Process
 1. Click the "Fork" button in the upper right of this GitHub page to make a copy of the translations for you to work with.
 2. Click the file you want to edit.
 3. Click the pencil icon.
 4. Edit the file to your heart's content! (**ONLY EDIT THE TEXT INSIDE THE TRIPLE QUOTES**)
 5. Write a brief summary of the changes at the bottom of the page.
 6. Hit "Commit changes".
 7. Repeat steps 2 to 6 on as many files as you would like to edit. Once finished, proceed to step 8.
 8. Click the "New pull request" button at the upper left of the GitHub page.
 9. Make sure the "Base fork" is "Arks-Layer/PSO2ENPatchCSV" and that the "Head fork" is your own.
 10. Click the "Create pull request" button and enter a title with a small summary.
 11. Click "Create pull request" again and your changes will be posted.
