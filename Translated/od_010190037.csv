text102#0,"""The Snow Banther and Snow Banshee that appear in Tundra can have parts such as horns or claws destroyed by inflicting a fixed amount of damage.  When performing partial destruction, drops may increase, or other special reactions depending on the boss."""
text103#0,"""For the Snow Banther and the Snow Banshee, when destroying all of the claws on their four limbs, it will cause their legs to slip during some actions, creating a major opportunity.  Since it can lead to attack or recovery chances, actively shoot for partial destruction."""
