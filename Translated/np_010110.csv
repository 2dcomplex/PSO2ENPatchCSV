11_voice_NPC_5011_104#0,"""Ten years ago it was a different story. I felt so alive in the face of crisis. It's not pleasant getting old. """
11_voice_NPC_5011_100#0,"""Do you think it's strange that I find inspiration in a simple object? Ha ha, you may be right."""
Jig_03_020#0,"""But you know that thrill you feel when you face a formidable foe? That's how I feel about weaponry."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_101#0,"""Repairs have never been my expertise, but it turns out to have its appeal. Perhaps I should say I like the challenge."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_100#0,"""You want to know about the weapons I've made in the past? There are too many to count, although I have no idea how many are still out there."""
Jig_05_020#0,"""I'm a craftsman, you see. Once I finish a piece, I move on to the next one. That's just how it is."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_105#0,"""If it wasn't for that war 10 years ago, I might still have fire in my belly."""
Jig_06_020#0,"""So many competent weapon weilders lost their lives in that conflict. That fight had terrible consequences. """
11_voice_NPC_5011_108#0,"""I don't know the story behind the war that was fought 10 years ago. I don't even think any ARKS members know much."""
Jig_07_020#0,"""That's partly because it's classified, but I think the main reason is people just don't want to remember."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_105#0,"""I'm not sure whether to be delighted or resentful that a maker of war weapons such as myself is valued so much here. It's difficult. """
11_voice_NPC_5011_101#0,"""Leave that weapon to me! On my honor as a craftsman, I'll fix it as good as new!"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_107#0,"""I sense this bad feeling so explicit, even I can feel it. What is about to happen...... """
11_voice_NPC_5011_101#0,"""It's no use dwelling on the past. I shall create a new weapon equally as powerful than that one! """
11_voice_NPC_11_101#0,"""If you plan on taking on Dark Falz, you definitely need much stronger weapons!"""
Jig_mb9_020#0,"""But how ironic that my opportunity to make use of my inspiration would come so early. """
11_voice_NPC_11_101#0,"""I can't make an Armagenesis, but I can create something frighteningly similar. I am confident that I can do so!"""
Jig_mb10_020#0,"""......however without the proper raw materials, it is only a hollow confidence. That's so irritating......"""
11_voice_NPC_11_105#0,"""That giant staff that I restored. That was completely abnormal. """
Jig_mb11_020#0,"""It was made without considering its effect on the person who would use it. Such that it sucks up all of the users' Photons."""
Jig_mb11_030#0,"""The person who made it in the first place, what on earth were they thinking......I struggle to understand."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_100#0,"""The strength of the weaponry does not equate to the strength of the equipped. Strength is not a one-sided relationship."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_104#0,"""Hmm......I've got a bad feeling about this. Ah, no. It's not the kind of premonition that might imply we're going to be attacked or anything. """
Jig_mb13_020#0,"""It's just a craftsman's intuition. Like I feel like someone is going to make an impossible order."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_104#0,"""These bad feelings do end up being true. I thought I'd just show my face since it's been a while, and I get a spectacular present instead. """
Jig_mb14_020#0,"""......but now that I'm relied upon, I must live up to expectations!"""

11_voice_NPC_5011_100#0,"""When the sign of the times desire powerful weaponry, it means that it is side-by-side with warfare. """
Jig_mb16_020#0,"""For me to be busy is a sign that it's not a great era to be in. It's sad, but true. """
Jig_mb16zeno_010#0,"""Well well, glad to see you are safe! When I heard Regius' communication I even doubted my own ears! """
