text101#0,"""Defeating enemies stimulates the photons in the atmosphere, which<br>affects the abilities of ARKS operatives. This effect is known as<br>PSE (Photon Saturation Effect).<br><br>PSE can cause anything from a simple boost in abilities, to an increase<br>in the amount of meseta dropped, or extra experience from combat."""
text102#0,"""There are eight levels of PSE, and the level rises as you continue<br>to defeat enemies, enhancing the effect produced.<br><br>When photons are stimulated at PSE level 8, a PSE burst is triggered.<br>This results in a dramatic stat boost due to the violent excitation of<br>atmospheric photons caused by cumulative PSEs."""
text103#0,"""This effect only lasts a limited time, but it can be extended by<br>defeating enemies to keep photons in a state of excitation.<br><br>A sign of some kind is given just before PSE is about to occur,<br>so keep an eye out and utilize PSE to its best effect."""
