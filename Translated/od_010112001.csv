text02#0,"""Well that's just wonderful! Let me be the one to file your performance report!"""
text03#0,"""So, here's the deal. Do your Ranger thing with the weapon I choose and take out the target hostiles, okay?"""
text04#0,"""Of course, it's not my fault if you get killed. Just go for the kill without getting yourself killed. Simply kill, kill, kill and you'll do fine!"""
text05#0,"""Okay, okay, okay. I hope you come back a hero instead of in a body bag. I'll be waiting right here, soâ€¦ GO!"""
