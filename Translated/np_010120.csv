11_voice_NPC_5012_104#0,"""I can't help but think that if I could have been an ARKS member myself, my fieldwork would go much smoother."""
Rogio_02_020#0,"""That's why I think so much of Aki, who is both an ARKS member and a scientist."""
11_voice_NPC_5012_104#1,"""I wonder why nobody is researching how to acquire the abilities needed to become an ARKS op."""
Rogio_03_020#0,"""Perhaps I ought to look into it myself. I think I'd need some help to pull it off, though."""
11_voice_NPC_5012_100#0,"""When you study geology and know how a planet is formed, that leads to an understanding of what kinds of resources can be found under its surface."""
Rogio_04_020#0,"""It's an extremely useful science, but it's not very glamorous, I'm afraid."""
11_voice_NPC_5012_100#1,"""My research would have suffered serious setbacks if I hadn't met you, <%me>."""
Rogio_05_020#0,"""I will be forever in your debt. I can't thank you enough for your help. No one else would even hear me out."""
11_voice_NPC_5012_103#0,"""Those who hesitate when given the chance to perform essential research are not true scientists. That's why I am going."""
11_voice_NPC_5012_100#2,"""Do you see scientists like us as being paranoid and strange? I guess that's only natural."""
Rogio_07_020#0,"""Scientists must have an inquisitive mind. When you no longer have passion for your work, you're done for. So I accept who I am."""
11_voice_NPC_5012_100#3,"""Thank you so much. I'll be in touch if I have any other requests. Good luck to you."""
11_voice_NPC_5012_104#2,"""This place serves as an ARKS base, but I wonder if the Darkers have a base as well."""
11_voice_NPC_5012_104#3,"""Just between you and me, the official records contain a number of inconsistencies. One day I'd like to get to the bottom of things."""
11_voice_NPC_5012_105#1,"""There are quite a few other scientists in ARKS, but few of them study photons."""
Rogio_11_020#0,"""Very little data has been disclosed. Given how crucial this data is to ARKS, I wonder why that is."""
11_voice_NPC_5012_101#0,"""When you seek the truth, you must accept the associated risks. I don't regret the path I have chosen, no matter what the outcome."""
11_voice_NPC_5012_105#2,"""Photons aren't the only area where data is lacking. The same goes for Darkers. Strange, don't you think?"""
11_voice_NPC_5012_105#3,"""I requested some photon research data the other day, but I have yet to be given access. What could be taking so long?"""
