un_010350_0010#0,"""Heya, partner! They said things are pretty sleepy<br>around here at the moment, so we don't need to<br>worry too much."""
un_010350_0020#0,"""Actually, come to think of it, we get an awful lot<br>of up-to-the-minute intel, don't we? Especially<br>in combat situations."""
un_010350_0025#0,"""It makes you wonder how they get that much data<br>on what's going on on the surface, what ops are<br>doing, what enemies are around..."""
un_010350_0030#0,"""It's got to be tough just keeping count of <br>everything, let alone relaying all that info to us."""
un_010350_0040#0,"""But they do it like it's no big thing. You take<br>it for granted, but ARKS is a pretty incredible<br>organization, don't you think?"""
un_010350_0050#0,"""Although even that doesn't explain how they can<br>predict some of these D-arker appearances.<br>Can you even calculate something like that?"""
un_010350_0060#0,"""I guess so, considering they keep doing it. Heh.<br>No point in somebody like me losing sleep over it.<br>All right, I should get back to it. Later, partner!"""
un_010350_0010#1,"""うーっす、相棒！<br>このあたりは小康状態みたいだから<br>そんな警戒しなくてもいいんだってさ。"""
un_010350_0020#1,"""そういや、前から気になってたんだけど<br>おれたちが戦闘している間も<br>常に戦況の最新情報が入電されるだろ？"""
un_010350_0025#1,"""惑星内のこととか、敵のこととか<br>アークス個人個人の状態に対して<br>よくもまああれだけ情報を出せるよな。"""
un_010350_0030#1,"""計算とか連絡とか<br>考えるだけでも大変そうだろ？"""
un_010350_0040#1,"""それをしれっとやっちゃうのが<br>アークスの地味なすごさなのかもな。"""
un_010350_0050#1,"""でも、敵の出現予知とかって<br>計算でできるようなもんなのか？"""
un_010350_0060#1,"""……ま、実際できてるんだし<br>細かいことは気にしなくていいか！<br>んじゃ、おれは行くぜ！　またな！"""
