un_012410_0020#0,"""Don't play dumb with me, you ignoramus!<br>That thing's been sighted all over, and I've<br>not received a single report from you!"""
un_012410_0030#0,"""What? You shouted but I didn't hear you?"""
un_012410_0040#0,"""Th-That's no excuse! You must not have<br>shouted hard enough! Huey always hears people<br>or photons or whatever in distress and runs off!"""
un_012410_0050#0,"""Huh, but that's odd. If shouts are sound waves,<br>they can't pass through a vacuum. How does<br>he hear people down on the surface?"""
un_012410_0060#0,"""And yet whenever I tag along with him, there<br>really are people in distress. What gives?"""
un_012410_0070#0,"""Oh, forget it! I don't care!"""
un_012410_0080#0,"""Anyway, this is all your fault for not reporting!<br>Shape up, or my next detonation spree has<br>your name all over it!"""
un_012410_0010#1,"""あっ、貴様！　許さないぞ！"""
un_012410_0020#1,"""何がって、とぼけるんじゃない！<br>アレがいろんな場所で見つかったのに<br>私に報告しなかっただろう！"""
un_012410_0030#1,"""……報告手段がなかった？<br>大声で呼んでも聞こえるわけない？"""
un_012410_0040#1,"""そ、そんなことはないはずだ！<br>だってあの人は、助けを呼ぶ声に<br>応じていつも何処かに行くぞ！？"""
un_012410_0050#1,"""んん？　でも、声とは波だから<br>惑星からの叫び声なんて<br>聞こえるわけないはず……？"""
un_012410_0060#1,"""でも、ついていくといつも<br>助けを求めている人がいるし……<br>……どうなっているんだ？"""
un_012410_0070#1,"""んんん……わっかんない！"""
un_012410_0080#1,"""もういいや！　とにかく貴様が<br>報告しないのが悪いことにする！<br>次からはきちんとやれよ、貴様！"""
