un_020110_0010#0,"""Hi, it's Pati! There are too many new<br>things happening these days!<br>I have no time off and I'm worn out!"""
un_020110_0020#0,"""Who am I supposed to blame!?<br>ARKS?　Or Operation Void<br> that seems to be constantly doing something?"""
un_020110_0030#0,"""There is a saying.<br>If you're tired, you should take a break.<br>... oh, hello, this is Tia."""
un_020110_0040#0,"""Just as I thought troubles were over with that rampaging dragon,<br> and now we discover a new planet!"""
un_020110_0050#0,"""Where did the peace and quiet go!<br>As an intel team we're all over the place!"""
un_020110_0060#0,"""But still, there's a lot<br> of new things that<br> we find or that occur all at once."""
un_020110_0070#0,"""And I thought that now that<br> the dragon troubles were over,<br> that they would expose problems within!"""
un_020110_0080#0,"""And that they'd tell us everything<br> so we wouldn't have to<br> investigate ourselves!"""
un_020110_0090#0,"""...so you just<br>want to be lazy."""
un_020110_0100#0,"""Saying that though, you're right in saying<br> they're really easy on internal audits here."""
un_020110_0110#0,"""Operation Void pretty much has free reign.<br>It seems that people who didn't<br> agree with that have left."""
un_020110_0120#0,"""That's why I was thinking<br> we could interview someone <br>who was part of the institute..."""
un_020110_0130#0,"""We can't find<br> anyone like that.<br>It's so weird! """
un_020110_0140#0,"""Though if we gave up here<br> we'd be failures as an intel team!"""
un_020110_0150#0,"""So Tia!<br>It's time to gather more information!"""
un_020110_0160#0,"""Who was saying earlier that<br> she was tired and wanted rest?<br> ...well, bye."""
un_020110_0010#1,"""はーい、パティちゃんですよー！<br>いやー最近新しいこと起こりすぎ！<br>ぜんっぜん休めなくてもうクタクタ！"""
un_020110_0020#1,"""誰を訴えればいいんだろう！<br>アークス？　それともやったら<br>動き回ってくれる虚空機関かな？"""
un_020110_0030#1,"""昔の人は言いました。<br>疲れてるなら休めばいいじゃない。<br>……あ、どうも、ティアです。"""
un_020110_0040#1,"""暴走龍の騒動が終わったと思ったら<br>次はヘンな惑星の発見！"""
un_020110_0050#1,"""いままでの静けさはどこへやら！<br>情報屋としてあっちこっち！"""
un_020110_0060#1,"""それにしても、立て続けに外で<br>何かが見つかったり起こったり<br>するよねぇー。"""
un_020110_0070#1,"""てっきり、暴走龍騒動が<br>終わったところで、内部の問題<br>洗い出しでもすると思ってたのに！"""
un_020110_0080#1,"""それでいろいろ明らかにしてくれて<br>調べる手間はぶいてくれると<br>思ってたのにー！"""
un_020110_0090#1,"""……それ結局<br>自分がサボりたいだけでしょ。"""
un_020110_0100#1,"""とはいえ、内部監査の甘さについては<br>パティちゃんの言うとおりだよ。"""
un_020110_0110#1,"""虚空機関は、わりとやりたい放題。<br>そういうのがイヤで機関を<br>ぬける人もいるみたい。"""
un_020110_0120#1,"""だから、元機関所属の人に<br>直撃インタビューできればって<br>思ってるんだけど……"""
un_020110_0130#1,"""なっかなかそういう人<br>見つけられないんだよねー。<br>これまたふっしぎー！"""
un_020110_0140#1,"""ま、この程度で諦めていたら<br>情報屋の名折れだからね！"""
un_020110_0150#1,"""さあ、ティア！<br>今一度、情報収集の時間だよー！"""
un_020110_0160#1,"""さっきまで疲れた休みたいって<br>言ってたのは誰だったっけ？<br>……それじゃ、また。"""
