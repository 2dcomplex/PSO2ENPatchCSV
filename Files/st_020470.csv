st_020470_0010#0,"""It seems that the facilities that originally existed around here <br>were being modified by Luther."""
st_020470_0020#0,"""Just like some sort of his testing grounds. <br>Perhaps, he's done tampering things to his<br>heart's content, then abandoned it thereafter."""
st_020470_0030#0,"""I could vomit, but thanks to his frivolity <br>our investigation is proceeding, so <br>I can't say much about it."""
st_020470_0040#0,"""Sorry, please wait a moment.<br>I'm sending the data to Xiao."""
st_020470_0050#0,"""It would have been best had he come here directly <br>himself, but it seems he couldn't."""
st_020470_0060#0,"""Don't ask me the reason why. I don't know.<br>Sometimes he'll say these detached-sounding<br>things, and it's really bothering me."""
st_020470_0070#0,"""Well, even so he's better than Xion, <br>or so he says."""
st_020470_0080#0,"""I'm bothered as well that you <br>understood that guy so easily but <br>there's not much I can do about it."""
st_020470_0090#0,"""Xiao said it before, that the reason he isn't<br>good at understanding Xion is intentional, <br>to keep others from understanding him."""
st_020470_0100#0,"""I believe that we conduct our communications <br> incomprehensibly <br>as Luther is trying to analyze them."""
st_020470_0110#0,"""In other words, we're basically trying to <br>ask for help, while we're under surveillance. <br>We must use roundabout expressions."""
st_020470_0120#0,"""Furthermore... Xion's current kin might be <br>poor at special communications."""
st_020470_0130#0,"""... Well, what's that to me?"""

st_020470_0010#1,"""このあたり、もともとあった施設が<br>ルーサーに改造されているみたい。"""
st_020470_0020#1,"""さながら、ルーサーの実験場ね。<br>一人で好き勝手にいじくって<br>やり尽くしたから放置、って所かしら。"""
st_020470_0030#1,"""反吐が出るけど、その移り気の<br>おかげで調査が進むんだから<br>……何とも言えないわね。"""
st_020470_0040#1,"""ごめん、ちょっと待ってて。<br>シャオにデータを送ってるから。"""
st_020470_0050#1,"""あいつが直接ここに来られれば<br>良かったんだけど、無理らしくてね。"""
st_020470_0060#1,"""理由は聞かないで。あたしも知らない。<br>あいつ、時々超然としたことを<br>言い始めるから困るのよ。"""
st_020470_0070#1,"""まあ、それでもシオンよりはまし、とは<br>シャオの言葉だけどね。"""
st_020470_0080#1,"""あっちは、そんなに簡単に<br>意味が通じちゃっても困るから<br>仕方がないんだろうけど。"""
st_020470_0090#1,"""この前、シャオも言ってたけど<br>シオンの意思疎通が下手なのは<br>他者に理解させないために、そうしてる。"""
st_020470_0100#1,"""ルーサーが解析しようとしてるから<br>それに理解できないかたちで<br>伝えるしかないんだと思う。"""
st_020470_0110#1,"""いわば、盗聴されてる状態で<br>なんとか助けを求めているようなもの。<br>迂遠な表現かくあるべし、ね。"""
st_020470_0120#1,"""あとは……今のシオンの縁者が特別<br>コミュニケーション下手なのかもね。"""
st_020470_0130#1,"""……ま、あたしには関係ないけど。"""
