st_047020_0010#0,"""As you've all seen it... this is the current state of the moon."""
st_047020_0020#0,"""And this is a telescopic picture of the colored part."""
st_047020_0030#0,"""That's gross... Are you saying those are all ESCA Darkers?"""
st_047020_0040#0,"""Needless to say, it looks like they're trying to make a \""road\"" down to Earth."""
st_047020_0050#0,"""If they arrived in such numbers... we wouldn't be able to handle it."""
st_047020_0060#0,"""Even for ARKS, fighting all those is... It's gotten to the point where putting the entire planet in an isolation field wouldn't be enough."""
st_047020_0070#0,"""To think they're endlessly spawning like that... Mother was saying she wasn't used to it yet. But this..."""
st_047020_0080#0,"""If their spawn point is centered on the moon, then Mother herself is also on the moon. Is that correct, Ms. Kohri?"""
st_047020_0090#0,"""Uh, um, I think. My memories are a bit blurry, but I think I was on the moon."""
st_047020_0100#0,"""Even so, the place where we went to rescue Hitsugi should have been destroyed... along with those two girls."""
st_047020_0110#0,"""Um... The place where Hitsugi was at was formerly used during the moon development and abandoned afterwards."""
st_047020_0120#0,"""The place Mother is at was created specifically for Mother... so it's a completely different place."""
st_047020_0130#0,"""Is that so? There seems to be an inconsistency with Earth Guide's information."""
st_047020_0140#0,"""Uh, but... I did seem to have a screw loose. I guess I could be wrong... Uhm, well... I'm sorry!"""
st_047020_0150#0,"""Why are you apologizing? I'm just complaining about how unreliable intelligence from Earth Guide can be. Your intel has nothing to do with it."""
st_047020_0160#0,"""Besides, there are other people you should be apologizing to."""
st_047020_0170#0,"""Oh... Uhm, I know I'm late, but... I've caused so much trouble for all of you in ARKS..."""
st_047020_0180#0,"""Unfortunately, all I can do is apologize, and apologize, and apologize, and apologize, and keep on apologizing!"""
st_047020_0190#0,"""No, no, Ms. Kohri was being controlled. There's no need to let it bother you so much."""
st_047020_0200#0,"""No, that's no good! If there's anything I can do, I'll do it! Just say the world! I'll obey you!"""
st_047020_0210#0,"""Even if you tell me that... I said..."""

st_047020_0230#0,"""Just say the word! Shall I take responsibility and impale myself to regain my honor? Although... I don't want to feel that much pain, so maybe an assisted suicide would be better?"""
