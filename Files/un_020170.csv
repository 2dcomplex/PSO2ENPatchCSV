un_020170_0020#0,"""Well, the air of a battlefield<br> is exceptional. Can't get enough of it.<br>Let's me forget about my worries."""
un_020170_0030#0,"""See, these days there's a lot going on right?<br>People are raising<br> doubts here and there."""
un_020170_0040#0,"""The ones that bother me most are the<br> self-proclaimed critics talking about right and wrong."""
un_020170_0050#0,"""Talking about what's right and wrong, no one<br>will conclude and agree on the same thing,<br>people should be doing what they need to."""
un_020170_0060#0,"""What's right is different from person to person.<br>And so is what's wrong."""
un_020170_0070#0,"""If they have enough free time<br> to find fault and deny others,<br> they should spend it on bettering themselves."""
un_020170_0080#0,"""Well, although I'm saying that,<br> I probably lack the ability<br> to talk about that too right?"""
un_020170_0090#0,"""But not thinking about it<br> and devoting yourself to bettering<br> yourself would probably feel better."""

un_020170_0040#1,"""正義だの悪だのと語りはじめる<br>自称評論家が一番面倒かな。"""
un_020170_0050#1,"""正義だ悪だなんて語っても<br>結論なんか出るわけないんだし<br>皆、やることやってりゃいいのに。"""
un_020170_0060#1,"""正義なんてものは人それぞれ。<br>悪の定義だって人それぞれ。"""
un_020170_0070#1,"""目くじら立てて他人を<br>否定する暇があるのなら<br>自分を高めることに費やすべきだよ。"""
un_020170_0080#1,"""といっても、そういうことを<br>表立って語るには、わたしは<br>まだちょっと実力不足かな？"""
un_020170_0090#1,"""まっ、ぐだぐだ考えずに<br>日々努力に研鑽に、のほうが<br>気持ちいいよね、きっと。"""
