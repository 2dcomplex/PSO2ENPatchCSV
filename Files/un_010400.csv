un_010400_0010#0,"""Heh, you come here often? It's always good to<br>run into another op. It seems like there's a lot <br>more ARKS traffic on Naberius lately."""
un_010400_0020#0,"""Before all those D-arkers showed up, you could go<br>for days without bumping into anybody."""
un_010400_0030#0,"""I guess that would be better, though, wouldn't it? <br>Ops only go where there's danger. It'd be best <br>if there was no reason to come here at all."""
un_010400_0040#0,"""Well, best for everybody but us. You and me, we'd be out of a job, ha ha. <br>Still, you can't knock peace, am I right?"""
un_010400_0050#0,"""Hm? You heard the same thing from somebody<br>else? Heh. It's nice to know there are other ops<br>out there that get it."""

un_010400_0050#1,"""ん？　オレと同じようなことを<br>言っているやつがいた？<br>それは気の合うことだな。"""
