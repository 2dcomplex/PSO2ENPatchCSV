st_045020_0010#0,"""Mother... Mr. Ophiel... How is Hitsugi doing? Do you know why she won't wake up?"""
st_045020_0020#0,"""Impossible, impossible, impossible! She was 100% dead! Slashed down without hesitation, and stabbed in the stomach. It's really disturbing, you know."""
st_045020_0030#0,"""Not really, Och. There could be zombies, I'd love to see one. By any chance, does your sword turn people into zombies?"""
st_045020_0040#0,"""But... Mother told me that this was the only way to save Hitsugi... Mother said..."""
st_045020_0050#0,"""I did. However, I didn't expect this level of power from you. It seems I misjudged your strength."""
st_045020_0060#0,"""Kohri Washinomiya. You have my sincere apologies. I allowed Histugi to be hurt, by your own hands. I'm sorry."""
st_045020_0070#0,"""N-No... it's not Mother's fault."""
st_045020_0080#0,"""Examination complete. There are no abnormalities in her body, everything is normal. There's no reason she should be comatose."""
st_045020_0090#0,"""Then... the problem lies in her heart."""
st_045020_0100#0,"""Her heart?"""
st_045020_0110#0,"""Yes. The embodient of ether is the manifestation of a person's will."""
st_045020_0120#0,"""Hitsugi Yasaka embodied her weapon with an unsure will, and because of that, it broke and crumbled. To put it simply... She's heartbroken."""
st_045020_0130#0,"""Weapons can be created over and over, but only because of your heart's will. However, if that will is crushed..."""
st_045020_0140#0,"""I see. So you're saying she lost the will to live? While that sounds a bit too poetic for me, it seems to be the only logical reason."""
st_045020_0150#0,"""Hitsugi..."""
st_045020_0160#0,"""But... with Mother's power, you can return Hitsugi back to normal, right?"""
st_045020_0165#0,"""That's..."""
st_045020_0170#0,"""Correct, Kohri Washinomiya. But first, we must eliminate those who decieved Hitsugi Yasaka. You understand who they are?"""
st_045020_0180#0,"""<%me> and ARKS... The people who broke Hitsugi's heart. I just need to erase those people, right?"""
st_045020_0190#0,"""Exactly. If you do that, Hitsugi Yasaka will return to normal like before."""
st_045020_0200#0,"""Wait and see, Hitsugi... I'm going to save you, no matter what. I'll make sure you never have to suffer again."""
st_045020_0210#0,"""To manipulate a child like that... even if it was for my sake, I don't like it."""
st_045020_0220#0,"""I understand your discontent, Mother. However, this is all for our objective."""
st_045020_0230#0,"""Please don't let it bother you. If someone must dirty their hands... I'd rather that role fall to me."""
st_045020_0240#0,"""Right... your role is to dirty your hands. I wonder how he really feels?! Maybe he's just a pervert that likes young women?"""
st_045020_0250#0,"""Och, are you upset that Mr. Ophiel rescued you?"""
st_045020_0260#0,"""W-Who said anything like that?!"""
st_045020_0270#0,"""In any case, the real danger here is that Kohri kid. Loving someone too much is really dangerous. She had me 50% shivering."""
st_045020_0280#0,"""Those types of people are usually called 'Yandere'. This will be good reference material, I must take notes."""
st_045020_0290#0,"""Mother... Is she really okay? She's felt 80% dangerous from the beginning."""
st_045020_0300#0,"""There's also established evidence that a Yandere is hard to deal with, whether friend or foe."""
st_045020_0310#0,"""問題ない。彼女の心はそう容易くは折れない。<br>鷲宮氷莉は自分の意志で八坂火継を救いたいと思い<br>ああして力を得たのだ。"""
st_045020_0320#0,"""オフィエルによる影響もあるだろうが……<br>彼女の願いは、純粋だ。"""
st_045020_0330#0,"""それよりも……オークゥ＝ミラー。<br>フル＝ジャニース＝ラスヴィッツ。"""
st_045020_0340#0,"""二人には過酷な任務を任せることになり<br>大変、申し訳なく思う。<br>私の不甲斐なさを、許して欲しい。"""
st_045020_0350#0,"""……そ、そんな。<br>マザー、謝らないで。"""
st_045020_0360#0,"""これが１００％の配役っていうのは<br>あたしたちもわかってるよ、マザー。<br>……というか、あたしが計算したんだしね。"""
st_045020_0370#0,"""……そのために、この前の出撃は我慢したし。<br>準備もばっちり整ってるから。まかせて。"""
st_045020_0380#0,"""これは、あたしたちにしかできない役目！<br>あたしたちは、マザーの望み通りに<br>２００％、やってやるわよ！"""
st_045020_0390#0,"""……世間から排除されそうだった<br>私とクゥを、救い上げてくれた。<br>その恩は、一生忘れない。"""
st_045020_0400#0,"""能力の高さに年は関係ないっての！<br>それをわかってくれたのは、マザーだけだった。<br>マザーが、あたしたちを認めてくれた。"""
st_045020_0410#0,"""……マザーのおかげで、私は文を極められた。"""

st_045020_0430#0,"""……それにこうして、力も得られた。<br>知らないことを、いっぱい知ることができた。"""
st_045020_0440#0,"""だからね。あたしも、フルも<br>マザーのために、力を使い切りたいの。<br>命を１００％燃やし尽くしても、後悔はないの。"""
st_045020_0450#0,"""……恩返しをさせて、マザー。<br>私たちを、人として扱ってくれた恩のお返しを。<br>それが、私の一番最初のメモだから。"""
