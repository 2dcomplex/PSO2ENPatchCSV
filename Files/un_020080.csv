un_020080_0020#0,"""Oh, sorry. These days, it seems there's<br> imitations of ARKS members.<br>They really thought of something troublesome."""
un_020080_0030#0,"""They copy the skills of the ARKS too.<br>That's troublesome as well..."""
un_020080_0040#0,"""But they copy our acquaintances.<br>That's the most troublesome."""
un_020080_0050#0,"""For example, if an ARKS member you're always fighting with, suddenly becomes your enemy. You would be surprised, of course."""
un_020080_0060#0,"""It's hard fighting against people you know.<br>That's obvious."""
un_020080_0070#0,"""But to think that the D-arkers<br> would plan out that sort of strategy..."""
un_020080_0080#0,"""To defeat that one person<br> we normally party with...<br> I don't want to think about it."""

un_020080_0030#1,"""アークスの実力を模倣してくる。<br>それももちろんやっかいだが……"""
un_020080_0040#1,"""知己の姿を真似てくる。<br>これが何よりも面倒だ。"""
un_020080_0050#1,"""例えばだ、いつも共に戦っている<br>アークスが急に敵に回ったら<br>当然、戸惑ってしまうだろう？"""
un_020080_0060#1,"""知己とは戦いにくい。<br>それは当たり前のこと。"""
un_020080_0070#1,"""だがまさか、ダーカーが<br>そのような作戦を講じてくるとはな……"""
un_020080_0080#1,"""いつもパーティを組んでいる<br>あいつを倒さねばならない……<br>考えたくもないことだ。"""
un_020080_0090#1,"""偽物とはいえ、アークス同士で<br>戦うのなんて、御免だ。"""
