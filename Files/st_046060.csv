st_046060_0010#0,"""Oh, <%me>."""
st_046060_0020#0,"""1. Is your body okay?"""
st_046060_0030#0,"""2. Still thinking about her?"""
st_046060_0040#0,"""Good, good, it's good. It wasn't much of an injury anyway. I'm fine, see."""
st_046060_0050#0,"""I was just thinking about Kohri."""
st_046060_0060#0,"""Haha... You can see right through me, <%me>."""
st_046060_0070#0,"""Kohri was the kind of child who couldn't do anything. She was bad at sports, and really hated studying. She was completely out of touch with reality."""
st_046060_0080#0,"""But even if nothing went right, she'd always smile, and was always cheery, somehow."""
st_046060_0090#0,"""I first met Kohri after I entered high school. I met her through Mother Cluster."""
st_046060_0100#0,"""Honestly, at first, I thought that she was kind of dull."""
st_046060_0110#0,"""Because she was always following me, I thought she was kind of annoying."""
st_046060_0120#0,"""That's why I was cruel to her, at first. But she still followed me. She was like a puppy dog when she was around me."""
st_046060_0130#0,"""...I wonder when it was? It was around the time me and Kohri joined the student council."""
st_046060_0140#0,"""You see, Kohri was bullied a bit. Having her things hidden, or pranks with her desk... That sort of thing went on for a while."""
st_046060_0150#0,"""Even then, Kohri continued to laugh. In front of me, laughing like she was happy."""
st_046060_0160#0,"""...Even though it was my fault. She always continued to laugh."""
st_046060_0170#0,"""Yes, I was originally the one they bullied."""
st_046060_0180#0,"""Kohri realized I was being bullied and put a stop to it. Because of her intervention, the bullies moved on to Kohri."""
st_046060_0190#0,"""I didn't even realize it, and kept thinking of her as a pest."""
st_046060_0200#0,"""One day, I happened to run across Kohri being bullied."""
st_046060_0210#0,"""But then, she... looked my way, and laughed."""
st_046060_0220#0,"""Kohri laughed, like she always had."""
st_046060_0230#0,"""I finally understood that her laughter meant that she was pushing herself."""
st_046060_0240#0,"""She's out of touch, so... I didn't even realize it was a signal saying that she needed help."""
st_046060_0250#0,"""I got into a fight with those bullies. The teachers quickly found us and scolded all of us. It didn't happen again afterwards."""
st_046060_0260#0,"""After that, Kohri stuck to me even more, and I accepted it."""
st_046060_0270#0,"""Remember how Kohri was laughing the other day? She was laughing just like that day with the bullies."""
st_046060_0280#0,"""I can tell. She laughs like that when she needs help."""
st_046060_0290#0,"""It's the same as before... She's suffering, while trying to help me."""
st_046060_0300#0,"""That's why I have to help her..."""
st_046060_0310#0,"""Ow!"""
st_046060_0320#0,"""Sorry, you're right. It's not \""I\"". It's \""we\"". We have to help her, right?"""
st_046060_0330#0,"""<%me>さん！<br>あっ、ヒツギさんも一緒ですね！<br>……むむむ、これは私、お邪魔虫でしたか？"""

st_046060_0360#0,"""えっ！？<br>高二の段階で、あんなスれた感じになるのはやだ！<br>あたしはもうちょっとバカがいい！"""
st_046060_0370#0,"""……言うじゃねえか、バカ妹。"""
st_046060_0380#0,"""げっ、兄さん……<br>ど、どうしてそんなところにいるのよ！"""

st_046060_0400#0,"""あ、そうです、そうでした！<br>エスカダーカーの反応が検知されたんです！"""
st_046060_0410#0,"""ちっ、また出てきやがったのか！<br>場所は！？"""
