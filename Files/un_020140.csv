un_020140_0010#0,"""Oh, hello.<br>You seem to working hard."""
un_020140_0020#0,"""That reminds me, do you know<br> this type of weapon?"""
un_020140_0030#0,"""This, is a Katana.<br>That Regius, head of the Three Victors<br> used this as his favored weapon."""
un_020140_0040#0,"""It seems that Regius<br> finally decided to teach the<br> techniques to the new generation"""
un_020140_0050#0,"""In other words, it's straight from Regius!　Maybe?<br>Haha, I don't have the skills<br> to boast about it just yet."""
un_020140_0060#0,"""Well, I'll teach you the<br> characteristics of the<br> Katana special to you!"""
un_020140_0070#0,"""So the characteristic of this type of weapon...<br> is umm... well,<br> all about timing."""
un_020140_0080#0,"""Take a deep breath, and draw your sword<br>at once! And in time with your enemy,<br>take the perfect counter attack!"""
un_020140_0090#0,"""...something like that.<br>It's why Regius didn't teach us until now.<br>It takes a lot of nerve."""
un_020140_0100#0,"""If you can't stay under control, and you lose<br>your composure, the Katana becomes useless.<br>It's a weapon that needs experience above all."""
un_020140_0110#0,"""But, the power is matchless<br> when you're in the proper form. <br>Well, you should try it once."""
un_020140_0010#1,"""やはっ、こんにちは。<br>がんばってるみたいだね。"""
un_020140_0020#1,"""そういやあなた、この武器種<br>知ってるかな？"""
un_020140_0030#1,"""これは、カタナ。<br>かの三英雄の筆頭、レギアスが<br>最も得意とする、特殊武装だよ。"""
un_020140_0040#1,"""レギアスがようやく<br>後進にその技術を伝える気に<br>なってくれたみたいでさ。"""
un_020140_0050#1,"""いわば、レギアス直伝！　かな？<br>ははっ、そう威張れるような<br>腕前でもないけどね、わたしは。"""
un_020140_0060#1,"""よーし、それじゃ特別に<br>おねえさんがカタナの特性を<br>ご教授してあげちゃおう！"""
un_020140_0070#1,"""武器種としての特性はー……<br>んー、そうだなぁ……とにかく<br>タイミングが重要な武器、かな。"""
un_020140_0080#1,"""呼吸を整え、一気に抜刀！<br>呼吸を合わせて、後の先を取る！"""
un_020140_0090#1,"""……そんな感じ。<br>レギアスが技術伝えないわけだよ。<br>すっごく神経を使うからねえ。"""
un_020140_0100#1,"""呼吸が合わず、心が乱れると<br>カタナ自身もなまくらになる。<br>なによりも経験が必要な武器だよ。"""
un_020140_0110#1,"""でも、そのぶん型にハマったときの<br>攻撃力なんかは、たまらない。<br>まあ、一度は触ってみ？"""
