st_048060_0010#0,"""Aru. And Ms. Kohri? This is an unusual combination, huh?"""
st_048060_0020#0,"""Big sis is talking to big bro, so I went for a walk and then Kohri..."""
st_048060_0030#0,"""Being able to read the mood is one of my strong points. You should never disturb a conversation between siblings, so we wandered around as outcasts."""
st_048060_0040#0,"""<%me> is currently out somewhere, so I guess that means I'm an outcast too."""
st_048060_0050#0,"""So let's get along with each other, fellow outcasts!"""
st_048060_0060#0,"""Oh, this is a good opportunity. I wanted to ask you something..."""
st_048060_0070#0,"""Ms. Xiera, what is your... no, what is everyone in ARKS' stance about our current situation?"""
st_048060_0080#0,"""What do you mean?"""
st_048060_0090#0,"""Let's see... Aru and Mother were both from the ARKS universe, and so were ARKS were still involved."""
st_048060_0100#0,"""However, you could say that ARKS has nothing to do with Ardem, and it's a problem that the planet should solve itself."""
st_048060_0110#0,"""In other words, Kohri wants to know if ARKS will help intervene in this."""
st_048060_0120#0,"""Yes."""
st_048060_0130#0,"""It's as Kohri says. If we try to interfere into the internal affairs of Earth, we simply wouldn't have enough ARKS. We have no reason to interfere, in fact."""
st_048060_0140#0,"""However... in this case, the issue is a result of Mother and the incidents that occurred after rescuing Aru."""
st_048060_0150#0,"""So there's no need to worry, Ms. Kohri. ARKS will offer their cooperation and support."""
st_048060_0160#0,"""I've already made the necessary calls. We even got authorization from Commander Ulc!"""
st_048060_0170#0,"""Was Kohri worried that <%me> and the others wouldn't help us?"""
st_048060_0180#0,"""Well... Kind of, I guess."""
st_048060_0190#0,"""There's no need to be worried. <%me> and Xiera are friends. Friends help each other when they need it, right?"""
st_048060_0200#0,"""If big sis, big bro, or Kohri were in trouble, I'm sure <%me> and the others would help!"""
st_048060_0210#0,"""Fufu, Aru's straightforward views are easy to get, and accurate."""
st_048060_0220#0,"""You understand, right, Ms. Kohri? Ms. Hitsugi, Mr. Enga, and you are all our friends."""
st_048060_0230#0,"""ARKS would never abandon a friend. Rest assured, you can count on us."""
st_048060_0240#0,"""Okay!"""
st_048060_0250#0,"""Besides, I'm personally interested in the technology of Earth. There's some things I wanted to ask about."""
st_048060_0260#0,"""For example, PSO2. That sort of technology to transfer to other universes should be possible with our technology too."""
st_048060_0270#0,"""PSO2? If that's all, I have it installed on this device right here."""
st_048060_0280#0,"""What?! M-May I borrow that device for a moment, Ms. Kohri?!"""
st_048060_0290#0,"""ほほうほうほう、なーるほど……<br>座標わかってるからこれをああしてー……<br>あー、やっぱりそうやってるのかー……"""
st_048060_0300#0,"""……いやー、やっぱり現物見られると<br>理屈が一気につかめるからいいですねー。"""
st_048060_0310#0,"""それじゃあこの見返りが<br>アークスの協力、ということで？"""
st_048060_0320#0,"""軽っ！<br>アークスの指揮権限軽すぎっ！"""
st_048060_0330#0,"""ふふっ、冗談です。"""
st_048060_0340#0,"""でもですね、コオリさんたちが<br>アークスの協力を仰ぐのは<br>その程度の軽さでいい、ってことですよ。"""
st_048060_0350#0,"""なんといっても、私たちは仲間ですから。<br>ねー、アルくん。"""
st_048060_0360#0,"""うん！"""
st_048060_0370#0,"""わわわわっ！\u3000なんですなんです！？"""
st_048060_0380#0,"""……ラスベガス近郊で<br>エーテルの異常値を計測！？"""
st_048060_0390#0,"""ううん、ラスベガスだけじゃない……！<br>地球全体のエーテル量が、変化してる！<br>まるで、地球全体を覆い尽くすように……"""
st_048060_0400#0,"""アルくん！？"""
st_048060_0410#0,"""……すごく、気持ち悪い。<br>無理矢理、何をしようとしてるの……？"""
