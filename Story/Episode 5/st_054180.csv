st_054180_0020#0,"""You worry too much Matoi. As I said, there's no abnormalities."""
st_054180_0030#0,"""There's nothing odd about their parameters, and I don't see signs of Darker Factor being too high."""
st_054180_0040#0,"""It's completely different from how the [Profound Darkness] transforms. Rather, that is something entirely else."""
st_054180_0050#0,"""What about you <%me>?<br>Do you feel anything off?"""
st_054180_0060#0,"""Well..."""
st_054180_0070#0,"""I hear voices..."""
st_054180_0080#0,"""Oi, it'll be annoying if they can see me. Don't say unnecessary things."""
