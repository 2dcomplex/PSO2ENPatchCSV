st_054062_0010#0,"""Welcome back you two. We suffered minimal damage thanks to your efforts."""
st_054062_0020#0,"""But, Xiao. Those Darkers were..."""
st_054062_0030#0,"""We have collected data from here too... Looking at our data, the energy readings indicate that the Darkers are in fact, being strengthened."""
st_054062_0040#0,"""We have to figure out why..."""
st_054062_0050#0,"""1. They're being influenced from Omega?"""
st_054062_0060#0,"""2. You've figured out a reason?"""
st_054062_0070#0,"""I cannot be certain yet, however that is a possibility we cannot ignore."""
st_054062_0080#0,"""Though I do not understand it yet, I feel I may be on to something."""
st_054062_0090#0,"""It seems it might be due to... influence from Omega?"""
st_054062_0100#0,"""We've calculated a result that linked the Black Hole's expansion with the strengthening of the Darkers."""
st_054062_0110#0,"""I guess when the Black Hole absorbs more worlds, isn't it as if the [Profound Darkness] is consuming them?"""
st_054062_0120#0,"""When we say that the [Profound Darkness] consumes what the Black Hole absorbs, it doesn't sound so far-fetched."""
st_054062_0130#0,"""The [Profound Darkness] corrupts all things, regardless of what nature."""
st_054062_0140#0,"""It only views the things the Black Hole absorbs as food, thus empowering itself every time."""
st_054062_0150#0,"""And when it grows stronger, the Darkers grow stronger as a result..."""
st_054062_0160#0,"""This became a more dire situation than originally thought of."""
st_054062_0170#0,"""The energy being absorbed by the Black Hole is huge. We won't be able to handle it."""
st_054062_0180#0,"""But before that... We first have to deal with Omega."""
