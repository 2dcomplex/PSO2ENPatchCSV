st_054070_0010#0,"""Gettemhart and Melphonsina, who were citizens<br>of Verun, decided to travel with the Guardian."""
st_054070_0020#0,"""Although large in numbers, not a single word<br>was uttered along the way."""
st_054070_0030#0,"""Umm, Gettemhart. Do you have anything to talk about while we're on break?"""
st_054070_0040#0,"""Hah, don't make me laugh. There's nothing to talk about."""
st_054070_0050#0,"""Hey, Gettemhart!"""
st_054070_0055#0,"""Please excuse him, I know he comes off being rude."""
st_054070_0060#0,"""No, it's fine. I don't think he means it... But even so, you two sure are close. What's your relationship with him?"""
st_054070_0070#0,"""Well, that's..."""
st_054070_0080#0,"""Both myself and Sina were experimental demon soldiers."""
st_054070_0090#0,"""Experimental demon soldiers?"""
st_054070_0100#0,"""Just as Cuent used Ephimera to create Devil Castles, Verun had its own magic."""
st_054070_0110#0,"""It's known as Demonization. Imbuing the body with Mana to augment its strength."""
st_054070_0120#0,"""Naturally, this magic could not be used unless one had high enough affinity with the subject. Only a few people could utilize it."""
st_054070_0130#0,"""However, this all changed with Ephimera."""
st_054070_0140#0,"""By simplying having the ability to use magic, Ephimera allowed one to perform this ability with ease."""
st_054070_0150#0,"""Of course, there's an overwhelmingly high amount of people who cannot use magic, compared to those who can..."""
st_054070_0160#0,"""Thus under imperial decree, a plan for the Imperial Demon Soldier Project had been carried out."""
st_054070_0170#0,"""It was a grand plan by the ever so grateful Emperor to convert the poor, magicless souls into powerful soldiers. Hahaha."""
st_054070_0180#0,"""That damned magical flower, known as Ephimera, did just that."""
st_054070_0190#0,"""So they forced those without magical affinity into demons. Likely by experimenting on their bodies..."""
st_054070_0200#0,"""Oh, an excellent guess, short stuff. So, is this coming from experience or something?"""
st_054070_0210#0,"""But by doing this, the body will burn out."""
st_054070_0220#0,"""Hahaha! That's right, short stuff. You guess as if you've seen it happen before!"""
st_054070_0230#0,"""But I bet you've never seen someone break from a surplus of Mana being poured in, have you? Did you know that there's various way one could break?"""
st_054070_0240#0,"""Gettemhart and I, were the first group of people from the Demon Soldier project. We're escapees from it."""
st_054070_0250#0,"""There were originally over four thousand of us, but now it's just us that remain. We're sure that no one else survived."""
st_054070_0260#0,"""Wait, but if your strength is due to the demonization, wouldn't your lives be..."""
st_054070_0270#0,"""Ha, I could care less about a damned life like this!"""
st_054070_0280#0,"""My one purpose is the Emperor. So I can crush him with these hands."""
st_054070_0290#0,"""I'll be sure that he will pay for messing with my life, Sina's and everyone elses, with his own damned life."""
st_054070_0300#0,"""So, Guardian... Don't start spouting the \""Ethics of Life\"" like some class act, alright?"""
st_054070_0310#0,"""We're on the same page regarding the Emperor, right? I'll do whatever's necessary. But if you get in my way, I'll crush you first."""
st_054070_0320#0,"""Please excuse him, he's being too direct... But I feel the same way."""
st_054070_0330#0,"""This life exists to avenge those who were killed by the Emperor's selfishness. I believe I only exist for that purpose."""
st_054070_0340#0,"""Both Gettemhart and myself will fight... To kill the Emperor."""
st_054070_0350#0,"""..."""
st_054070_0360#0,"""1. Scared?"""
st_054070_0370#0,"""2. What's the matter?"""
st_054070_0380#0,"""Oh, sorry, my mind was in a blank. Oh, sorry, my mind was in a blank. While I did feel scared, there were other things I was curious about..."""
st_054070_0390#0,"""Oh, sorry, my mind was in a blank. I'm just feeling nervous."""
st_054070_0400#0,"""These Demon Soldiers. Its similar to the story on how the Photoners created ARKS."""
st_054070_0410#0,"""Abducting a large number of organisms with hardened bodies, then strengthening their bodies and adding Photons from within, to force utilization of them..."""
st_054070_0420#0,"""There were records of mass causalties in attempts to stabilize and replicate the process. It truly was a horrible act."""
st_054070_0430#0,"""Even if it's Omega, to have this repeated... We have to stop this..."""
