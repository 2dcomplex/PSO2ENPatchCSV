st_013420_0010#0,"""Phew, was that the first stage? This looks like a break point."""
st_013420_0020#0,"""しっかし、このまえあんだけのダーカーと戦った惑星で戦技大会ってすげー判断だよな。"""
st_013420_0030#0,"""まあ、ここに対する恐怖感というか不安感の払拭を兼ねているのかもしれないけどさ。"""
st_013420_0040#0,"""おれがずいぶん前に相棒へ頼んだ依頼のような感じで。"""
st_013420_0050#0,"""でもなー、なんだろーなー。確かにすごい危険な感じはないんだけどなんか不安なんだよな……"""
st_013420_0060#0,"""いや、不安だけでもないのか。何だろうなこれ、懐かしいような怖いような……あー、よくわからん！"""
st_013420_0070#0,"""Hahahaha! Hey there, participants! I hope you're enjoying yourselves!"""
st_013420_0080#0,"""Huey, Huey! I want to take part too! Let me join in!"""
st_013420_0090#0,"""You're part of the staff... Ahem... time to report the current standing!"""
st_013420_0100#0,"""...Right now, the pair in the lead is the Ranger Afin and <%me>!"""
st_013420_0110#0,"""Oh, I think I've heard that name before..."""
st_013420_0120#0,"""As a leader, it's great to see new ARKS do well! Good luck to them!"""
st_013420_0122#0,"""Next, the pair of the Force Marlu and the Hunter Ohza!"""
st_013420_0124#0,"""But it seems like the rumored Information Sisters are also working hard!"""
st_013420_0126#0,"""Who?"""
st_013420_0140#0,"""Nonetheless, it's neck-and-neck! The ARKS Battle Championship is a fierce struggle! The tide could turn at any moment!"""
st_013420_0150#0,"""Hey, Huey. Aren't you just reading from your notes? How's that fun?"""
st_013420_0160#0,"""The second half of the game begins here, so we expect you to do your best! That's all!"""
st_013420_0170#0,"""Look, Claris Claes. I know that becoming an adult can be a sad thing. But sometimes we need to follow the script."""
st_013420_0175#0,"""For now, let's read up about the participants."""
st_013420_0180#0,"""Well... I'm glad that we're in the lead... I can't focus with this feeling."""
st_013420_0190#0,"""I wonder what this is. Partner, do you feel it too? Is it just me? Well..."""
